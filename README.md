# TURNING-ON-BULB-LAMP-USING-PUSH-BUTTON-Decoration-
# I. ABSTRACT 
Turning on bulb lamp using pushbutton, is arduino based project which is used for decoration.  We are going to explain in all details how it can work. This project will help for lighting all decoration-designs with only one push. The benefits of implementing our project as solution it will provide good appearance in Christmas lighting, rooms, events i.e. wedding ceremony, birthday’s party.
# II.	PROBLEM STATEMENT
The current decorations without bulb lamp are not very brilliant as we wish. And it is hard to control the ordinary lighting decoration’s design but with our project it require only one press to control or designs, the loss of trees and other vegetation for using in decoration can cause climate change, increase greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

# Description
This block diagram contains many different electronic components such as push buttons, Arduino uno board, relays, lamps and AC supply.
These two push buttons are installed in parallel, the push button1 is used to start our installation with long press for one second and also the push button2 is used to stop this installation with long press for one second. The purpose of this long press is to prevent disturbance of someone who can press some of these push buttons by an accident which can disturb our decoration.
When you press on push button1 these all four lamps are lighting alternatively. There is a timing of two seconds between one lamp and each other. After alternatively all lamps are lighting at the same time, then after two seconds the system restart again.
At any time the push button2 is pressed a long one second the system will be stopped.
